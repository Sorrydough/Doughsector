Location: Hyperspace outside Tri-Tachyon Blacksite
Date: 210.03.05

After several skirmishes with ships of unknown design, Tri-Tachyon dispatch a phase contingent to their closest outpost intending to replicate the success they experienced against the Hegemony some months prior.

During routine patrols, they caught a small patrol fleet in-system. It escaped, but they learned their lesson - This site had to be held in hyperspace. A task they were uniquely suited for, they set up an ambush.

It only took a couple days of waiting. Their wish was soon fulilled... although maybe not by the sort of fleet they hoped to see.
