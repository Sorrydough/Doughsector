Location: TT Frontier Hyperspace
Date: 210.03.05

After several skirmishes with ships of unknown design on the frontier, Tri-Tachyon dispatch a phase contingent to crush this new threat before it cuts into their bottom line.

During routine patrols at an outpost, a small fleet is caught shadowing you.
The enemy is slippery and escapes to the jump point but the lesson is clear - This system has to be held in hyperspace. A task you're uniquely suited for, an ambush is set.

It only took a couple weeks. You call general quarters as a warfleet screams in at full burn.

- BLUFOR has Phase Coil Tuning. Your flagship has:
Impact Mitigation, Systems Expertise and Elite Polarized Armor.
- REDFOR has Electronic Warfare. Their admiral has:
Gunnery Implants, Systems Expertise and Elite Target Analysis.
