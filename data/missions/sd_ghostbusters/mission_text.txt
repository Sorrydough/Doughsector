Location: TT Frontier Hyperspace
Date: 210.03.05

After several skirmishes with ships of unknown design on the frontier, your phase contingent is dispatched to pre-emptively crush this new threat before it can do serious damage.

During routine patrols at an outpost, a small fleet is caught shadowing you.
The enemy is slippery and escapes to the jump point but the lesson is clear - This system has to be held in hyperspace. A task you're uniquely suited for, an ambush is set.

It only took a couple weeks. You call general quarters as a warfleet screams in at full burn.

4th Wall Analysis:
- Your Furies are commanded by aggressive crew, and your Afflictors are steady.
- Your fleet benefits from Phase Coil Tuning. Your flagship has Impact Mitigation, Systems Expertise, Polarized Armor, Elite Helmsmanship and Elite Field Modulation.
- The opposing fleet has Support Doctrine. The opponent's flagship has Gunnery Implants, Systems Expertise, Helmsmanship, Target Analysis, Missile Specialization and Elite Point Defense.
- Your enemy has improved ship and fleet command AI, which will show you no mercy.
- This is a symmetrical engagement. Both fleets have the same DP and skill budget.
