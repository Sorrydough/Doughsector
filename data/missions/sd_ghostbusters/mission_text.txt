Location: TT Frontier Hyperspace
Date: 210.03.05

After several skirmishes with ships of unknown design on the frontier, Tri-Tachyon dispatch your phase contingent to crush this new threat before it cuts into their bottom line.

During routine patrols at an outpost, a small fleet is caught shadowing you.
The enemy is slippery and escapes to the jump point but the lesson is clear - This system has to be held in hyperspace. A task you're uniquely suited for, an ambush is set.

It only took a couple weeks. You call general quarters as a warfleet screams in at full burn.

Analysis:
- Most ships in both fleets are commanded by aggressive crew.
- Your fleet benefits from phase coil tuning. The opposing fleet benefits from electronic warfare.
- You personally have Impact Mitigation, Systems Expertise, Polarized Armor, Elite Helmsmanship and Elite Field Modulation.
- REDFOR's flagship has Gunnery Implants, Systems Expertise, Helmsmanship and Elite Target Analysis. Their 2nd has Elite Point Defense.
