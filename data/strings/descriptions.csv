sd_ionbeam_fighter,WEAPON,An ion beam unremarkable in all ways other than its miniaturization.
sd_kineticblaster_fighter,WEAPON,"Developed independently to the kinetic blaster present in the persean sector, this inferior version has a variety of unresolved side effects restricting its practical use exclusively to disposable drone fighters."
sd_gravlance,WEAPON,"Although superficially similar to a graviton beam, this smaller version exhibits dramatically different behavior more similar in function to a classical needler."
sd_grapeshotrack,WEAPON,Launches proximity-fused canisters of antimatter. Reloading is quite simple compared to other missiles of its size.
,,
sd_decoylauncher,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches flares that interfere with point-defenses.
sd_grapeshotarray,SHIP_SYSTEM,Dispenses proximity-fused canistersof  antimatter.
sd_auxforge,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Replenishes missiles or fighters, depending on which is more depleted. Generates flux upon activation."
sd_mnemonicarmor,SHIP_SYSTEM,Rebalances the ship’s armor grid. More flux intensive on heavily armored ships.
sd_motearmor,SHIP_SYSTEM,Rebalances the ship’s armor grid and has powerful side-effects. More flux intensive on heavily armored ships.
sd_hackingsuite,SHIP_SYSTEM,Interferes with the target’s shipsystem and autofire accuracy. Automated ships suffer additional duration.
sd_nullifier,SHIP_SYSTEM,Accelerates the decay of the target’s combat readiness and normalizes their timeflow with that of realspace. Generates flux according to the magnitude of the timeflow correction.
