sd_ionbeam_fighter,WEAPON,An ion beam unremarkable in all ways other than its miniaturization.
sd_kineticblaster_fighter,WEAPON,"Developed independently to the kinetic blaster present in the persean sector, this inferior version has a variety of unresolved side effects restricting its practical use exclusively to disposable drone fighters."
sd_gravlance,WEAPON,"Although superficially similar to a graviton beam, this smaller version exhibits different behavior more similar to a needler."
sd_grapeshotrack,WEAPON,Dispenses proximity-fused antimatter canisters. Reloading is quite simple compared to other missiles of its size.
,,
sd_decoylauncher,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches flares that interfere with point-defenses.
sd_grapeshotarray,SHIP_SYSTEM,Dispenses proximity-fused antimatter canisters.
sd_auxforge,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Replenishes small missiles or fighters, whichever is more depleted. Generates flux upon activation."
sd_mnemonicarmor,SHIP_SYSTEM,Rebalances the ship’s armor grid. More flux intensive on heavily armored ships.
sd_motearmor,SHIP_SYSTEM,Rebalances the ship’s armor grid and has powerful side-effects. More flux intensive on heavily armored ships.
sd_hackingsuite,SHIP_SYSTEM,Interferes with the target’s shipsystem. Especially dangerous to automated ships.
sd_nullifier,SHIP_SYSTEM,Accelerates the decay of the target’s combat readiness and normalizes their timeflow with that of realspace. Generates flux according to the magnitude of the timeflow correction.
,,
sd_fightersupport,SHIP,"An advanced support fighter, it also benefits from its parent ship’s range bonuses."
sd_fighterblaster,SHIP,"Experimental and notably unstable, the Excision mounts a prototype kinetic blaster inherently unsuitable for manned deployment. Linked to its carrier via a neural interface to avoid direct operator exposure, the system is vulnerable to disruption and limited by the fleet’s electronic warfare capabilities."
sd_fighterion,SHIP,"Functionally a swarm of tiny ion beams, this expendable remote-controlled drone fighter excels at disabling isolated targets or distracting for other smart weapons. The need for a realtime commlink to the host ship makes its engagement range dependent on the fleet’s electronic warfare capabilities."
sd_fightercanister,SHIP,"While lacking the firepower that other bombers provide at this logistics profile, the Hail is durable and easy to rearm, allowing it to keep the pressure up in protracted engagements with its versatile bombload."
