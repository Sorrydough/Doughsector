A tier: Mods with a well-executed vision but have bloat, questionable design decisions, or need improvements to their sector-wide integration.

Legio Shipworks
Vayra's Sector
Ship/Weapon Pack
Roider Union
Osiris Alliance
Kyeltziv Technocracy
Magellan                (good integration although a lot is still left on the table, weapon bloat)
HMI                     (extreme bloat, lots of amazing ideas left unfinished regarding HMI company and the mess)

B tier: Mods with great ideas that are marred by bad balance, extreme bloat, art issues, or severe lack of integration.
Bultach Coalition       (bad balance, huge amount of weapon bloat, but good integration)
Diktat Enhancement      (I want a version that just does the campaign-level changes without adding any ships or weapon)
DME                     (insane degree of weapon bloat, integration could use some work, art is great and BB are a fun boss faction tho)
UAF                     (great ideas but the author seems to think that modding is done exclusively in the graphics folder)
Scalartech              (great concise faction but it has zero integration whatsoever so it's just save bloat that doesn't interact with gameplay)
Iron Shell              (I want the tax system standalone)
Interstellar Imperium   (weapon bloat, bad integration)
VIC                     (weapon bloat, very bad integration)
Scrapyard Armory        (Huge variations in quality of art, not much bloat, excellent integration)
