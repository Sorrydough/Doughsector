Mission Stuff:
- Need to prevent ships from ever retreating during a mission cuz the player's certainly won't!
- Need a custom AI admiral to prevent frigates from getting themselves singled out and killed

Ship System Stuff:
- Create a toggle system that doubles armor for damage calc, increases maxiumum damage blocked by armor to 100%, and generates 3x the ship's shield upkeep while active.
