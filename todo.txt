Ship System Stuff:
- Configure AI threat indicators for ship systems
- Make the AM canisters go vaguely in the direction of the nearest threat instead of being completely random
- Write custom quantum disruptor AI
- Figure out why the PD overdrive orb doesn't seem to rotate

Misc Stuff:
- Calculate effective DPS of soft flux vs. high compared to vs. low tech for my own sanity
- Description strings

Aesthetic Stuff:
- Use fade engines to color function to make them change color randomly in combat
- Implement glowmaps for blinkers and friends

Generic AI Stuff:
- Improve venting behavior - needs to use starficz' calculate incoming damage utility
- Figure out how to fix the issue with carriers getting stuck in a flux dissipation loop
- Alter squall weapons.csv data - DO NOT USE VS FRIGATES, and USE VS SHIELDS?

Campaign Stuff:
- Make a placeholder faction with the fleets randomly patrolling near caches
- Add songs

Art Her Stuff:
- Really Converted Hangars
- Export, Pirate, Path skin variants
- Hullmod icons
- Make the sensor get blown

Post-Release Stuff:
- crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)
- global combatplugin for RTS mode
    5% range?
    very good autofire accuracy?
    25% less recoil?
    free target anal?
- some sort of ship marriage system to capture the hearts and dicks of redditors
- Script to make weapons look nice in the refit screen
- Combat warning noise for missiles hitting your flagship
- Make sure the forum download link is hidden behind a simple riddle
- When a fleet contests your salvage, options are: Fight them, split it, pay them off, threaten them, or leverage your faction rep (either it being high or low!)

investigate stasis field for support destroyer - use custom data like on quantum disruptor, check if you can modify timescale on projectiles, cope with modifying velocity, speed and maneuverability if not
return customdata to quantum disruptor, alter stats to have very short duration, scale its range based on the optimal range of installed weapons
morphic cascade - rebalances ship's armor. generates hard flux based on amount of armor regenerated. Implement emp arcs, custom AI, make sure it's unusable if the armor grid is fully balanced
have arthr whip up a version of the capital that doesn't have canisters
implement carrier shipsystem - generates hardflux, instantly restores some fighter replacement rate, smoke comes from bays, can also restore missiles, use the restoration costs of missile autoloader
strings retard
use orange as my "high-tech bullshit" color - emp arcs, hexshields, venting, etc
compose ship name string file
lunalib compatibility
interfere with commissioned crews and substance abuse
change AI flags on breach SRMs to make them suck less ass
