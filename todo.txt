Do These Right Now:
- Update sprites with less-compressed versions
- Implement proper thrusters
- Custom weapon slot IDs
- Name the fuckin ships
- Update fighter and hull IDs
- Add a blinker to capital

Do These Later:
- magicthrusters need to generate smoke and glow; fer_EnginePlugin.addFlare(engine, flareData, shipAPI);
- crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)
- global combatplugin for RTS mode
    5% range?
    very good autofire accuracy?
    25% less recoil?
    free target anal?

Shit for Art Man:
- Really Converted Hangars
- Export, Pirate, Path skin variants
- Hullmod icons
- Maybe revive the old frigate carrier as a battle wall thingie?
- Reskins for certain fighters - wasp, dagger
