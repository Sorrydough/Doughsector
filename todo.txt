Attack: Most generic variant, focused on having good flux uptime and decent range.
Strike: High alpha strike, usually short ranged and needs allied ships to distract for itself.
Aegis: Focused on being as tanky as possible with good point defense.
Command: Dedicates most of its budget to ECM and nav buoy.
Overdriven: Safety Overrides. Usually a variation of a strike loadout.
Specialist: Designed for some niche purpose.
Snare: Uses extensive crowd control tools to disable opponents.
Elite: Uses s-mods, great at everything.

Ghostbusters Stuff:

Version 1.0 Stuff: (first 'official' release, no advanced campaign mechanics)
- Make a placeholder faction
- Make sure the forum download link is hidden behind a simple riddle
- Add music
- Do another pass on ship stats (armor, dissipation, speed)
- STRINGS - writing theme: from the perspective of a vanilla faction assessing the ship... or maybe from the perspective of feedback that I've recieved regarding the ship?

- Reverse-engineer fleet deployment manager
- Do a manual sprite pass to clean up floaters etc


Version 1.5 Stuff: (easy to do, but not a priority)

- Hullmod that adds hardflux dissipation based on the shield arc
- Debug ship.setForceCarrierPullBackTime()
- Integrate engine color fade for all systems
- Glowmaps for decos
- Hardened Shields Sidegrade: Costs slightly less, makes shields narrower, increases shield efficiency...?
- Create engine reigniter hullmod
- Figure out a better way to display skills in main menu missions
- ensure that two ships don't accidentally use hacking suite on the same target simultaneously
- add status indicators for mnemonic armor - armor % imbalanced, % armor remaining - maybe use an indicator above the hull bar
- do another pass to nerf my fighters dissipation & change hexshield to disable the shield until 0 flux, instead of disabling for a flat amount of time
- make kinetic blaster fighter damage itself

Version 2.0 Stuff: (agent fleet, proper colony behavior)
- Improve venting behavior - needs to use starficz' calculate incoming damage utility, account for beams, breaches, termination system
- Expand upon custom fleet command AI so it can work in campaign
- When a fleet contests your salvage, options are: Fight them, split it, pay them off, threaten them, or leverage your faction rep (either it being high or low!)
- Run a checksum on my own mod so I know when people have tampered with it
- Add a functionality to the attack manager where it chooses between engage or eliminate depending on whether enough ships ar enearby to actually kill the target immediately
- Check if it's possible to apply an avoid order to a waypoint

- CR rework to make retreating from fights a thing
- Have AI fleets salvage their destroyed ships back into their fleet if you're disengage cheesing them, Maybe even salvage YOUR ships??
- Potential storypoint effects: Reconfigure hullmods/smods/loadouts, summon support fleet upon disengagement, restore ships to combat readiness, minefield


Version 3.0 Stuff: (scope creep)
- Modify tags on various vanilla weapons to improve AI behavior - squalls & breach srms for starters
- Interfere with commissioned crews and substance abuse somehow
- In my discord, have a bot command that mutes your target for 5 minutes at the cost of muting you for 15 minutes
- Crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)

- Some sort of waifu system to capture the hearts and dicks of redditors
- Script to make weapons look nice in the refit screen
- Smods rework - dmods and smods share slots, if you gain a dmod it replaces an smod, smods increase DP by 10% each, use alex's "buff" class to implement
- Write a guide for fleet command AI
- Write a guide for shipsystem AI
- Custom quality captains
