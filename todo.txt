Ship System Stuff:
- Make the AM canisters go vaguely in the direction of the nearest threat instead of being completely random

Misc Stuff:
- Calculate effective DPS of soft flux vs. high compared to vs. low tech for my own sanity
- STRINGS - writing theme: from the perspective of a vanilla faction assessing the ship

Aesthetic Stuff:
- Use fade engines to color function to make them change color randomly in combat - blue blinker color and orange technobullshit color
- Implement glowmaps for blinkers and friends

Generic AI Stuff:
- Improve venting behavior - needs to use starficz' calculate incoming damage utility
- Alter squall weapons.csv data - DO NOT USE VS FRIGATES, and USE VS SHIELDS?
- Alter breach SRMs behavior
Campaign Stuff:
- Make a placeholder faction with the fleets randomly patrolling near caches
- Add songs

Art Her Stuff:
- Really Converted Hangars
- Export, Pirate, Path skin variants
- Hullmod icons
- Make the sensor get blown

Post-Release Stuff:
- crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)
- global combatplugin for RTS mode
    5% range?
    very good autofire accuracy?
    25% less recoil?
    free target anal?
- some sort of ship marriage system to capture the hearts and dicks of redditors
- Script to make weapons look nice in the refit screen
- Combat warning noise for missiles hitting your flagship
- Make sure the forum download link is hidden behind a simple riddle
- When a fleet contests your salvage, options are: Fight them, split it, pay them off, threaten them, or leverage your faction rep (either it being high or low!)

lunalib compatibility
interfere with commissioned crews and substance abuse
modify tags on various vanilla weapons to improve AI behavior
figure out some way to make my ships stop trying to rotate their armor
in my discord, have a bot command that mutes your target for 5 minutes at the cost of muting you for 15 minutes

Weapon ideas:
Small size graviton lance: Kinetic support beam that just does a bunch of soft flux to shields in a quick burst
Medium size antimatter canister launcher: like an energy damage PCL that saturates an area with lower hit strength

Add another fighter:
5 OP, 2 heavily shielded support fighters, each armed with an advanced optics graviton lance and a PD laser.

Hardened Shields Sidegrade: Costs slightly less, makes shields narrower, increases shield efficiency.

Shipsystem ideas:
Temporal Shell: It's temporal shell.
^ Done
Canister Antimatter: Canflak except energy damage.
^ Done
Morphic Armor: Toggle system, rebalances the ship's armor grid. Generates flux based on shield upkeep and amount of armor HP rebalanced.
^ Done.
Auxiliary Microforge: Restores 10% fighter replacement rate, or 2 reload cost worth of missiles rounded up. Restores the lower one proportionally. Stores 3 charges, generates 25% base cap hardflux on use.
^ Done.
Hacking Suite: Shuts off the system of the targeted ship, forcibly disables it for a period of time.
^ Done.
Entropy Chronoboost: Increases rate of PPT and/or CR degredation of the target.
^ Should be easy to code but needs wack AI script

look at vic modplugin to see how to swap a script at runtime
