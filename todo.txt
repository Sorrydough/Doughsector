Attack: Most generic variant, focused on having good flux uptime and decent range.
Strike: High alpha strike, usually short ranged and needs allied ships to distract for itself.
Aegis: Focused on being as tanky as possible with good point defense.
Command: Dedicates most of its budget to ECM and nav buoy.
Overdriven: Safety Overrides. Usually a variation of a strike loadout.
Specialist: For some niche purpose.
Snare: Uses extensive crowd control tools to disable opponents.
Elite: Uses s-mods as the basis of its fit, great at everything.

- Add "acceptable hull damage" check to further improve epicness


Hullmod stuff:
- Create engine reigniter hullmod
- Hullmod that adds hardflux dissipation based on the shield arc

- Hullsize-appropriate engine boost sounds
- Debug ship.setForceCarrierPullBackTime()
- Integrate engine color fade for all systems
- Glowmaps for blinkers & hangar
- Figure out a better way to display skills in main menu missions

Version 2.0 Stuff: (agent fleet, proper colony behavior)
- Expand upon custom fleet command AI so it can work in campaign
- When a fleet contests your salvage, options are: Fight them, split it, pay them off, threaten them, or leverage your faction rep (either it being high or low!)

- Have AI fleets salvage their destroyed ships back into their fleet if you're disengage cheesing them, Maybe even salvage YOUR ships??
- Potential storypoint effects: Reconfigure hullmods/smods/loadouts, summon support fleet upon disengagement, restore ships to combat readiness, minefield


Version 3.0 Stuff: (scope creep)
- Modify tags on various vanilla weapons to improve AI behavior - squalls & breach srms for starters
- Interfere with commissioned crews and substance abuse somehow
- In my discord, have a bot command that mutes your target for 5 minutes at the cost of muting you for 15 minutes
- Crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)

- Some sort of waifu system to capture the hearts and dicks of redditors

- Custom quality captains
- Console command to buy stuff and have it shipped to you
