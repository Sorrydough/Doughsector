- Debug ship.setForceCarrierPullBackTime()
- Integrate engine color fade for all systems

- Hardened Shields Sidegrade: Costs slightly less, makes shields narrower, increases shield efficiency...?
- Create engine reigniter hullmod


Version 2.0 Stuff: (agent fleet, proper colony behavior)
- Expand upon custom fleet command AI so it can work in campaign
- When a fleet contests your salvage, options are: Fight them, split it, pay them off, threaten them, or leverage your faction rep (either it being high or low!)
- Run a checksum on my own mod so I know when people have tampered with it
- Add a functionality to the attack manager where it chooses between engage or eliminate depending on whether enough ships ar enearby to actually kill the target immediately
- Check if it's possible to apply an avoid order to a waypoint
- Make SO count as a dmod

- When your ships are destroyed in combat, they become salvageable derelicts in the system later
- CR rework to make retreating from fights a thing
- Have AI fleets salvage their destroyed ships back into their fleet if you're disengage cheesing them, Maybe even salvage YOUR ships??
- Potential storypoint effects: Reconfigure hullmods/smods/loadouts, summon support fleet upon disengagement, restore ships to combat readiness, minefield


Version 3.0 Stuff: (scope creep)
- Improve venting behavior - needs to use starficz' calculate incoming damage utility, account for beams
- Modify tags on various vanilla weapons to improve AI behavior - squalls & breach srms for starters
- Interfere with commissioned crews and substance abuse somehow
- In my discord, have a bot command that mutes your target for 5 minutes at the cost of muting you for 15 minutes
- Crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)
- Global combatplugin for RTS mode: 5% range?, very good autofire accuracy?, 25% less recoil?
- Some sort of waifu system to capture the hearts and dicks of redditors
- Script to make weapons look nice in the refit screen
- Smods rework - dmods and smods share slots, if you gain a dmod it replaces an smod, smods increase DP by 10% each, use alex's "buff" class to implement
- Write a guide for fleet command AI
- Write a guide for shipsystem AI
- Custom quality captains
