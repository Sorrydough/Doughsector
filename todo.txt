Do These Right Now:
- Name ships
- Description strings for everything
- Move the sensor rotating code into an EFS, yoink it from the vanilla sensordish deco weapon
- Write the flux vacuum script
- Set up FER vector thruster rendering
- Use FER to dynamically render flares to add splash of pink and purple
- Make arthr blow the sensor up to XL size
- Implement glowmaps for blinkers and sensor
- Make a placeholder faction with the fleets randomly patrolling near caches
- Fix siegemode bug with missiles getting bonuses applied twice
- Make siege sensor go back and forth instead of 360 degrees
- Script to make weapons look nice in the refit screen

Do These Later:
- crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)
- global combatplugin for RTS mode
    5% range?
    very good autofire accuracy?
    25% less recoil?
    free target anal?
- some sort of ship marriage system to capture the hearts and dicks of redditors

Shit for Art Man:
- Really Converted Hangars
- Export, Pirate, Path skin variants
- Hullmod icons
- Maybe revive the old frigate carrier as a battle wall thingie?
- Reskins for certain fighters - wasp, dagger
- Destroyer carrier might need an extra engine in the middle
- Siege destroyer looks a bit goofy with 2 extra aux thrusters
