Attack: Most generic variant, focused on having good flux uptime and decent range.
Strike: High alpha strike, usually short ranged and needs allied ships to distract for itself.
Aegis: Focused on being as tanky as possible with good point defense.
Command: Dedicates most of its budget to ECM and nav buoy.
Overdriven: Safety Overrides. Usually a variation of a strike loadout.
Specialist: For some niche purpose.
Snare: Uses extensive crowd control tools to disable opponents.
Elite: Uses s-mods as the basis of its fit, great at everything.

Version 2.0 Stuff: (agent fleet, proper colony behavior)

- Potential storypoint effects: Reconfigure hullmods/smods/loadouts, summon support fleet upon disengagement, restore ships to combat readiness, minefield


Version 3.0 Stuff: (scope creep)
- Modify tags on various vanilla weapons to improve AI behavior - squalls & breach srms for starters
- Interfere with commissioned crews and substance abuse somehow
- In my discord, have a bot command that mutes your target for 5 minutes at the cost of muting you for 15 minutes
- Crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)
- Global combatplugin for RTS mode: 5% range?, very good autofire accuracy?, 25% less recoil?
- Some sort of waifu system to capture the hearts and dicks of redditors
- Script to make weapons look nice in the refit screen
- Smods rework - dmods and smods share slots, if you gain a dmod it replaces an smod, smods increase DP by 10% each, use alex's "buff" class to implement
