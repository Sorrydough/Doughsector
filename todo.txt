Attack: Most generic variant, focused on having good flux uptime
Strike: High alpha strike, usually short ranged and needs allied ships to distract for itself.
Aegis: Focused on being as tanky as possible with good point defense.
Snare: Specialized against fast ships and typically includes emp.
Command: Dedicates most of its budget to ECM and nav buoy.
Overdriven: Safety Overrides. Nuff said.


Arthr Stuff:
- Hullmod icons
- Deco addons according to hullmod upgrades, ie additional shield emitters, beefier thrusters, converted hangar, etc
- Export, Pirate, Path skin variants
- Generalized revision pass
    Frigate needs to not look like I bashed it (maybe I can fix this?)
    Interference frigate needs to not look like I bashed it
    Heavy frigate needs to not look like it got spammed with the clone tool
    Destroyer needs to not look like ass
    Light cruiser needs to not have super exposed reverse thrusters
    Heavy cruiser needs to not look unsettling
    Capital needs to become a battlecarrier and lose some pointless mounts, also needs aux thrusters adjusted
    Nebula needs salvage gantry

- Post-release sprite pass to incorporate capital's greeble style


Discord Beta stuff:
- Write AI script for nullifier
- Fix nullifier still not resetting its color fade somehow
- Do motefield campaign behavior stuff
- Fix all the variants that I broke
- Placeholder descriptions
- Faction flag
- Integrate starficz shield AI
- Integrate genir autofire AI
- Finalize kite now that arthr fucked with it, figure out why its hangar sprite is offset
- Decide whether to put builtin advanced optics on capital
- Decide what to do with civilian builtin heavy armor
- Unbreak fighter ammo


Version 1.0 Stuff: (first 'official' release, no advanced campaign mechanics)
- Make a placeholder faction
- Make sure the forum download link is hidden behind a simple riddle
- Add music
- Do another pass on ship stats (armor, dissipation, speed)
- STRINGS - writing theme: from the perspective of a vanilla faction assessing the ship... or maybe from the perspective of feedback that I've recieved regarding the ship?
- Add a rawdog config file for non-lunalib-users
- Reverse-engineer fleet deployment manager


Version 1.5 Stuff: (easy to do, but not a priority)
- Commissioned crew effect: Improved CP regeneration
- Hullmod that adds hardflux dissipation based on the shield arc
- Debug ship.setForceCarrierPullBackTime()
- Integrate engine color fade for all systems
- Glowmaps for decos
- Hardened Shields Sidegrade: Costs slightly less, makes shields narrower, increases shield efficiency...?
- Create engine reigniter hullmod
- Figure out a better way to display skills in main menu missions
- ensure that two ships don't accidentally use hacking suite on the same target simultaneously
- add status indicators for mnemonic armor - armor % imbalanced, % armor remaining - maybe use an indicator above the hull bar
- do another pass to nerf my fighters dissipation & change hexshield to disable the shield until 0 flux, instead of disabling for a flat amount of time
- make kinetic blaster fighter damage itself
- Missile autoforge rework - add a graphical bar above shield strength to show restoration capacity (project solace has an example?)
- Make motes stop fucking running into asteroids


Version 2.0 Stuff: (agent fleet, proper colony behavior)
- Improve venting behavior - needs to use starficz' calculate incoming damage utility, account for beams, breaches, termination system
- Expand upon custom fleet command AI so it can work in campaign
- When a fleet contests your salvage, options are: Fight them, split it, pay them off, threaten them, or leverage your faction rep (either it being high or low!)
- Run a checksum on my own mod so I know when people have tampered with it
- Add a functionality to the attack manager where it chooses between engage or eliminate depending on whether enough ships ar enearby to actually kill the target immediately
- Check if it's possible to apply an avoid order to a waypoint
- Make SO count as a dmod
- Make ships not shoot if asteroid is in the way


Version 2.5 Stuff: (Advanced agent interaction)
- When your ships are destroyed in combat, they become salvageable derelicts in the system later
- CR rework to make retreating from fights a thing
- Have AI fleets salvage their destroyed ships back into their fleet if you're disengage cheesing them, Maybe even salvage YOUR ships??
- Potential storypoint effects: Reconfigure hullmods/smods/loadouts, summon support fleet upon disengagement, restore ships to combat readiness, minefield


Version 3.0 Stuff: (scope creep)
- Modify tags on various vanilla weapons to improve AI behavior - squalls & breach srms for starters
- Interfere with commissioned crews and substance abuse somehow
- In my discord, have a bot command that mutes your target for 5 minutes at the cost of muting you for 15 minutes
- Crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)
- Global combatplugin for RTS mode: 5% range?, very good autofire accuracy?, 25% less recoil?
- Some sort of waifu system to capture the hearts and dicks of redditors
- Script to make weapons look nice in the refit screen
- Smods rework - dmods and smods share slots, if you gain a dmod it replaces an smod, smods increase DP by 10% each, use alex's "buff" class to implement
- Write a guide for fleet command AI
- Write a guide for shipsystem AI
- Custom quality captains
