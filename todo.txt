Ship System Stuff:
- Make the AM canisters go vaguely in the direction of the nearest threat instead of being completely random

Misc Stuff:
- Calculate effective DPS of soft flux vs. high compared to vs. low tech for my own sanity
- STRINGS - writing theme: from the perspective of a vanilla faction assessing the ship
- Do another pass on ship names

Aesthetic Stuff:
- Use fade engines to color function to make them change color randomly in combat - blue blinker color and orange technobullshit color
- Implement glowmaps for blinkers and friends

Generic AI Stuff:
- Improve venting behavior - needs to use starficz' calculate incoming damage utility, account for beams
- Modify tags on various vanilla weapons to improve AI behavior - squalls & breach srms for starters

Campaign Stuff:
- Make a placeholder faction with the fleets randomly patrolling near caches
- Add songs

Art Her Stuff:
- Really Converted Hangars
- Export, Pirate, Path skin variants
- Hullmod icons

Post-Release Stuff:
- crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)
- global combatplugin for RTS mode
    5% range?
    very good autofire accuracy?
    25% less recoil?
    free target anal?
- some sort of ship marriage system to capture the hearts and dicks of redditors
- Script to make weapons look nice in the refit screen
- Combat warning noise for missiles hitting your flagship
- Make sure the forum download link is hidden behind a simple riddle
- When a fleet contests your salvage, options are: Fight them, split it, pay them off, threaten them, or leverage your faction rep (either it being high or low!)

interfere with commissioned crews and substance abuse
figure out some way to make my ships stop trying to rotate their armor
in my discord, have a bot command that mutes your target for 5 minutes at the cost of muting you for 15 minutes

Hardened Shields Sidegrade: Costs slightly less, makes shields narrower, increases shield efficiency.


look at vic modplugin to see how to swap a script at runtime
