Version 2.0 Stuff: (agent fleet, proper colony behavior)

Version 3.0 Stuff: (scope creep)

- Modify tags on various vanilla weapons to improve AI behavior - squalls & breach srms for starters
- Interfere with commissioned crews and substance abuse
- In my discord, have a bot command that mutes your target for 5 minutes at the cost of muting you for 15 minutes
