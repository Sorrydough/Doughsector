Attack: Most generic variant, focused on having good flux uptime and decent range.
Strike: High alpha strike, usually short ranged and needs allied ships to distract for itself.
Aegis: Focused on being as tanky as possible with good point defense.
Command: Dedicates most of its budget to ECM and nav buoy.
Overdriven: Safety Overrides. Usually a variation of a strike loadout.
Specialist: For some niche purpose.
Snare: Uses extensive crowd control tools to disable opponents.
Elite: Uses s-mods as the basis of its fit, great at everything.
