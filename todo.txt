Do These Right Now:
- Name the fuckin ships
- Finish the flak system

Do These Later:
- magicthrusters need to generate smoke and glow; fer_EnginePlugin.addFlare(engine, flareData, shipAPI);
- crew overflow marginally improves PPT and module repair speed (enemies always get full crew lol)
- global combatplugin for RTS mode
    5% range?
    very good autofire accuracy?
    25% less recoil?
    free target anal?
- some sort of ship marriage system to capture the hearts and dicks of redditors

Shit for Art Man:
- Really Converted Hangars
- Export, Pirate, Path skin variants
- Hullmod icons
- Maybe revive the old frigate carrier as a battle wall thingie?
- Reskins for certain fighters - wasp, dagger
- Destroyer carrier needs an extra engine in the middle

Requirements for first release:
- Set up descriptions for systems, ships, fighters
- Sort out systems for the siege and vacuum destroyers
